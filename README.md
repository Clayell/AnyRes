# AnyRes
A simple KSP mod to change to any resolution.

# Why?
I have gotten really tired of having to go in and edit the settings.cfg file, then restart KSP just so I can use my own custom resolution.  I decided I didn't want to have do deal with this and wrote this simple pugin to maky my life easier.  I hope it can save some time!

==================================
Forum user @CliftonM write this nice little utility which changes the screen resolution on the fly.  He hasn't been around since August, and since I use this, I'm adopting it.  Original thread is here:  https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/134621-12

New Dependencies

Click Through Blocker
ToolbarController
What does it do?

It allows you to quickly and easily change the screen resolution and switch between fullscreen and windowed.  You can use any resolution imaginable as long as it is  positive number.

How do I use it?

In any scene, simply press alt + /, or click the toolbar button if it's available.  It will automatically open up when you're in the settings menu.

I was never happy with the original interface, and took this opportunity to redo it in a cleaner method.  The changes I've done include:

Rewrote all windows to make it a much simpler interface
Removed the confusing presets windows
Created Changelog file
Added support for ToolbarController, for Blizzy toolbar support
Added settings page for Toolbar control
Added Toggle on window for toolbar control
Dependencies

This mod is now dependent on two other mods, the Click Through Blocker and the Toolbar Controller.  These mods are not included in the download, you need to download and install them yourself.  CKAN installs will automatically install them

There is a hard dependency on the Click Through Blocker mod, available here:
